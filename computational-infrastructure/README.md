# computational-infrastructure

This document outlines and documents the services used for computing infrastructure to support the development of data-driven, interactive visual representations. 

## Prototyping

### [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/)

A cloud-based development environment. *Cloud9 combines a powerful online code editor with a full Ubuntu workspace in the cloud. Simply pick your configuration and develop your app. No need to spend valuable development time on system setup and maintenance. You can create, build and run any development stack in seconds. We maintain it, you control it.*

## [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)

AWS is a provider of could computing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). It is the service provider of choice for the M.S. Data Visualization for a variety of reasons:  
- Comprehensiveness of computing services. [Gartner continues to recognize AWS for having the most fully realized set of services, having both the furthest completeness of vision and the highest ability to execute](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2G2O5FC&ct=150519&st=sb&refid=em_28713).  
- Generous in-kind support for free use of services for academic work.  
- Thoroughness of documentation and strong community of users and contributors. 

### [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/)

*AWS Educate provides an academic gateway ... to provide students and educators with the resources needed to accelerate cloud-related learning endeavors.* Students at The New School qualify for $100 in AWS credits each year as well as free and discounted training and labs.  

### AWS services

There is a dizzying array of AWS services, but students in the program will primarily use these:

#### Computation: [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

*Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.*

#### Database: [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)

*Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.*

#### Deployment: [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)

*AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services.*

## [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

This Database as a Service supports the ability to *deploy, operate, and scale a MongoDB database in the cloud*.  

## [Github](https://github.com/)
  
*GitHub is a development platform inspired by the way you work. From open source to business, you can host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside millions of other developers.*  

Every student and faculty member maintains an individual account. Additionally, the program maintains a GitHub organization at:  
[https://github.com/visualizedata](https://github.com/visualizedata)

The process for making contributions to the MSDV organization is defined at:  
[https://github.com/visualizedata/github-workflow](https://github.com/visualizedata/github-workflow)

GitHub pages allows you to use a repository to create a website (front-end only):   
[https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)

## Program site

In the 17/18 academic year, the program will support the collaborative development of a front-facing site, to be hosted at http://parsons.nyc
